                I was able to work a real project called Net 24 which is a website from Montepio Bank.
                I spent most of the time at the front-end, but I also worked on the back-end.
                In addition to this, I learned more about desing patterns, cloud and did a basic Spring Boot academy project.

                This was my first professional experience, and I am very grateful to ITSector and all the people I interacted with and who helped me,
                with special thanks to <Link href={"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbrites/"}>Jo√£o Brites</Link>, who was responsible for giving me tasks
                and providing all the help I needed.

              <p>
                I was able to work a real project for the Software Engineering students core at University of Minho Cesium.
                The name of the project that I integrated is Karaokium.
                I only worked at the front-end, basically developing html some pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                I really love this experience, not only for the project itself, but by all the organized activities during this summer camp.
